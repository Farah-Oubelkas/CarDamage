# Car Damage Detection with SwAV + YOLOv8 + DETR

This repository presents a novel deep learning framework that integrates **SwAV-based unsupervised contrastive learning**, **CD-RPN-K region proposal generation**, and a **transformer-based DETR object detector** to identify different types of car damage under uncontrolled conditions.

## üöó Overview

Car damage detection in real-world environments is challenged by noise, lighting conditions, reflections, and occlusions. This model addresses these problems by combining:

- **Feature encoder (`fŒ∏`)** for deep visual representations.
- **CD-RPN-K** to generate high-quality object proposals from raw input images using a contrastive and image-enhancement approach.
- **SwAV module** to learn robust representations from these proposals via swapped prediction.
- **DETR head** that predicts bounding boxes and damage categories using transformer-based end-to-end detection.
